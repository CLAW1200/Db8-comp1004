## Project Description
A single page website that can demonstrate the functionality and idea of Db8 to stakeholders, investors and potential team-members, in the most clear and concise way possible.

## Background
The Debate Project (known internally as Db8) is a future social platform for holding open and constructive discussion online. The technical scale and development of this project will be quite large and will require a team of people before full production can begin. 
To get this project off the ground, it will need to be pitched to many different people. In order to aid with this task, I will create a Minimum Viable Product called Db8-DT (Debate Demo Tool).
The goal is to have a simple yet effective tool that can demonstrate the functionality and use-cases of Db8 to peers and stakeholders to get them onboard with being involved while collecting the maximum amount of validated learning about customers [1]. This should be achieved through a single page website that contains sample features for each key aspect of Db8, making for quick iteration of designs.
